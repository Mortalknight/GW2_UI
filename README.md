# GW2 UI

**GW2 UI** is a meticulously crafted interface replacement that aims to increase immersion, as well as efficiency, without relying on dependencies. 

The entire UI is hand-painted, and hand-coded, to provide the best experience possible for players. Each interface element has been (or will be) rewritten, to provide enhanced functionality as well as improve the user experience, over the default UI.

This UI is designed for players who want a quick-and-easy, plug-and-play interface that returns focus to the game world, not spreadsheets.

### FEATURES
  - Hand-painted, dynamic interface art
  - Clean and user-friendly design
  - Hand-painted class power icons, with improved animations
  - Brand new, immersive questing interface
  - Redesigned and improved inventory interface
  - Brand new and enhanced quest tracker, complete with tracking compass and boss frames 


### KNOWN ISSUES
Not compatible with the *"Paste"* addon (action bars will appear empty). This may also occur if you are using older versions of the "StrataFix" addon.
*There is a new version from "Paste" which works with this UI: [Paste working version][newPastAddon]*
